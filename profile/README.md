**Devaloop** is an experimental software lab focused on the intersection of code, sound, and creative tools.  
We build open-source projects that help musicians, developers, and curious minds shape new ways of making.

## 🎯 Mission

To empower creative coding through lightweight, expressive tools —  
whether you're composing music, crafting audio engines, or building DSLs for artistic expression.
